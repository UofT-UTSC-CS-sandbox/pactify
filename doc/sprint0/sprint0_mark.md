## Product Backlog.md (Max 20 marks) 
  - Sufficient stories created to occupy team for next 4 sprints (max 5 marks)

    Your mark: 4

    User stories 15-20 are quite similar and may overlap in implementation, likely involving creating templates and changing configuration/prompts rather than separate features. Thus, while comprehensive, the backlog may not fully occupy the team for four sprints.

    You can break down the user experience for your main features instead.

 Presentation quality Total Mark: 4 / 5

 Some inconsistency in the format (single bullet point in `product.md` highlight). 

 Motivation and product description are too long and presented in dense paragraphs.

 Breaking it down into smaller sections or using bullet points for features and benefits would improve readability and organization.

---
## Git Practices and conventional commits: (max 4 marks)
    - 4 marks = Set up and followed git flow, squashed and merged into main, used conventional commits
    - 2 marks  = Set up and followed git flow, squashed and merged into main

Git Convention Total Mark: 1 / 4

Show some effort in git flow but did not use squash and merge nor conventional commits. Main branch commit history is messy.

E.g. "docs: add contribution section to README.md"
instead of just "Update README.me"


## Total Mark  
85 / 100
