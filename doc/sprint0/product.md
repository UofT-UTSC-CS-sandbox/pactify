# Pactify/The Algoholics

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Pactify is a website that anyone can use to create an AI generated draft of a contract or agreement by providing certain information and details. Many small business owners and individuals lack the resources to hire a lawyer for drafting contracts, which can be both time-consuming and costly. Pactify addresses this issue by providing a quick, affordable, and accessible way to generate various types of contracts, such as NDAs, prenups, hiring agreements, and more. It's also perfect for creating informal agreements, like those between friends. Users will be able to create an account and choose what type of contract they need to draft. They then enter specific details about what they want included into the contract. After this, the site will output a generated contract that the user can edit and download as a PDF, ensuring that it can be shared and signed. In addition to generating new contracts, Pactify offers a feature to upload existing contract files. The AI will be able to analyse these contracts and suggest areas that could be improved upon, ensuring that all contracts are up-to-date and compliant with current standards. Users can also view a history of the contracts they have generated, making it easy to manage and reference past agreements. Pactify automatically keeps a version history of your documents, so you can always go back if you don't like the changes you have made.

Overall, Pactify is designed to simplify the contract creation process, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their legal expertise or budget. By leveraging the power of AI, Pactify ensures that users can quickly produce high-quality contracts that meet their specific needs, providing a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.

#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)



#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Users would choose Pactify because of its convenience, affordability, and speed (i.e. it’s legal ease!). Pactify is designed for those who don’t have the time or money to put together a contract in mind, such as small business owners, freelancers, landlords, and the like.

Today, people are having to go to a lawyer to get a legally binding contract, or draft it on their own. Compared to traditional contract creation, Pactify is an infinitely more convenient option, as you can access it online at any time, you never have to talk to another person, you can choose one of many preset templates we have, and it takes just minutes to get a finished contract, rather than waiting weeks or even months for a contract to be drawn up by a lawyer (since we use AI to generate a contract faster than you can say “amicus curiae”). You can also e-sign, export, edit, download, and view all your previously generated contracts all through Pactify.

Most importantly, Pactify is free, representing a 100% savings over getting a lawyer (who charges hundreds of dollars per hour) to write your contract.

### Highlights

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process. Here are few questions that can guide you
 - There was much debate over which project we should choose for this assignment. We spoke with the owners of 2 BRIDGE projects and were initially debating between them. The first one was the creation of a WhatsApp bot, and although the project did seem feasible, we felt that the project did not align with the content that would be taught in this course. The other BRIDGE project seemed very promising, however since there were many other teams who were in contact with him, the owner thought that each team could work on a single component of the project without any direct communication betweeen teams. This solution did not appeal to us, as it would be difficult to coordinate with the other teams without direct communication, and the idea of the project is to design a complete app. Therfore we decided to move forward with our own project.
