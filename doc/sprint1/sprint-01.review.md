# Pactify/Algoholics

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration Saturday, June 15th ~ Online Discord - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

<!-- (Optional) Short introduction -->
#### Short Introduction

We focused on developing a presentable version of our prototype for Pactify. Our goals included implementing key features and setting up a strong foundation for the application. This reflection will document on our progress, challenges, and successes.

#### Team Reflection

Our team worked collaboratively to achieve the goals set for this iteration. Here is a summary of our reflections:

##### What Went Well

- **Effective Communication:** Regular online meetings on Discord helped us stay aligned and address issues promptly.
- **Task Management:** Since we clearly defined tasks and priorities as it team it ensured that we stayed focused and productive all the while keeping each other accountable.
- **Collaboration:** Overall we collaborated effectively, sharing knowledge and assisting each other. We used Discord as way to solve issues we were having promptly.

##### Challenges Faced

- **Technical Hurdles:** Setting up the development environment and integrating the frontend with the backend presented some challenges. Also structuring the repository and getting everyone accostomed to the repository took quite some time.
- **Time Management:** Balancing project work with other commitments was occasionally difficult for team members. Especially, when we had other course work due it was hard to prioritize C01 over more pressing due dates.

##### Lessons Learned

- **Planning:** Detailed planning and clear role definitions could further improve our efficiency.

##### Action Items for Improvement

- **Enhanced Early Planning:** Spend more time in the initial planning phase to foresee potential challenges.


#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- Using Tailwind for front end which helps with formatting using styling.
- Meeting up after C01 classes to disgest new information from lecture and updating each other with potential problems that could not be solved over Discord.
- Using Figma to make a prototype early on that helped build front end development smoothly.
- Staying active on Discord and activley joining online group meetings kept us on track and updated with each other's progress. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

 - Focusing on coding and leaving documentation to the end. 
 - Not doing enough research on MongoDb.
 - Not setting up the database earlier. 


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

- We will try to meet up more in person as it seems to be productive and raises morale. 

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

- We completed everything from our original iteration.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
  
 - N/A


## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.

- **Figure Out Contract Storage:** Determine how to store contracts as different file types such as pdf, doc, docx, etc. We will be using GCP or AWS to handle file storage and management. Which should hopefully ensure scalability and security for our users data.

- **Enhance User Authentication:** Improve the user authentication system to include features such as password recovery and two-factor authentication. This should hopefully enhance the security and reliability of our platform and all in all making out application more roubust and well rounded.

- **Contract Generation using ChatGPT** Implement the ability to generate contracts that follow a certain template using ChatGPT API calls. We would also like include some level of personalization using said ChatGPT API calls.
